# Introduction

## Background

Router orders are getting bigger, new customers and services are stirring the soup. NDC Networks is facing a serious problem, they are running out of resources. Router configuration by hand is no longer an option.

NDC Networks is a small Finnish company based in Espoo. The company is known for its expertise in networks, Virtual Private Network (VPN) management and router configuration. Routers that technicians at NDC Networks configure are mostly mobile routers. Different mobile routers do exist, but the basic idea is that it can be connected to mobile network using a traditional Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card and is capable of changing its point of attachment to the Internet, moving from one link to another link (Ernst & Lach, 5). Because of the possible different features and demands though, configurations must be unique for each customer.
